        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A spice bag (or spicebag, spicy bag, spice box or spicy box) is a fast food dish, 
            popular in most of Ireland and inspired by Asian cuisine.
            The dish is most commonly sold in Chinese takeaways in Ireland.
            Typically, a spice bag consists of deep-fried salt and chilli chips, salt and chilli chicken 
            (usually shredded, occasionally balls/wings), red and green peppers, sliced chili peppers, 
            fried onions, and a variety of spices. A vegetarian or vegan option is often available, 
            in which deep fried tofu takes the place of the shredded chicken. 
            It is sometimes accompanied by a tub of curry sauce.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut chicken thighs in to small pieces, discarding any fatty bits. 
                    In a medium bowl, stir together the buttermilk and hot sauce. 
                    Add chicken to marinade and let stand at least 20 minutes, 
                    or cover and refrigerate to marinate longer.</li>
                <li>While chicken is marinating, make spice mix by combining all ingredients in a small bowl. 
                    Stir to combine well. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Start your fries cooking.</li>
                <li>In a large, flat dish, prepare the flour dip by combining the ingredients and 
                    stirring well to combine. Take a few pieces of the chicken from the marinade and 
                    toss in the flour dip. Return to the buttermilk marinade briefly and dip in the 
                    flour dip again. Place on a metal cooling rack, while you proceed to bread all the 
                    chicken pieces. When all the chicken has been breaded, 
                    heat a 1/2-inch or so of oil in a skillet over medium high heat. 
                    Fry the chicken, until golden on the underside, then flip over and fry on the other side. 
                    Cook until golden and cooked through. Remove all chicken to a plate.</li>
                <li>Discard most of the oil from the skillet, leaving just a tiny bit. 
                    Return the skillet to the stove-top over medium-high heat. 
                    Add the peppers and onion and saute quickly until lightly browned and softened. 
                    Add sauteed vegetables to a large bowl. Add the warm chicken and cooked fries. 
                    Sprinkle with a generous amount of Spice Mix, to taste and toss well to coat.</li>
                <li>Spoon in to paper bags to serve</li>
            </ol>
