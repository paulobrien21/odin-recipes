        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A chicken fillet roll, also known as a hot chicken 
            roll or chicken roll, is a baguette filled with a fillet of chicken.
            It is a ubiquitous deli item in Ireland, served at a wide variety of convenience shops, 
            newsagents, supermarkets, petrol stations, fast food restaurants, 
            and casual eateries throughout the country. It has been declared Ireland's favourite deli food. 
            It is often cited as a hangover cure.
